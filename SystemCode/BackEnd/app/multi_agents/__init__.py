Multi-agent scheduling system.

This package defines a set of agent classes that work together to
parse user intent, retrieve knowledge, load user preferences from
memory, schedule tasks using an existing OR-Tools solver, and verify
the resulting schedule. A simple orchestrator stitches these agents
together into a pipeline.
